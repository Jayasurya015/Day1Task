Q)	Difference between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2?

For every TCP connection there is only one request and response. But HTTP/1.1 supports connection reuse	Uses multiplexing, over a single TCP connection. It is done using streams and it also provide feature called server push. 
Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about status of message(24 status code) and its error reporting is quicker and efficient	Headers and status code of HTTP remains same.
It uses digest authentication and NTML authentication	Security concern from previous version will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However it is better equipped to deal with them 
It has additional header like cache-control	Does not change much in terms of caching with server push. If the client find resource present already in cache it cancel the push stream
Text Based protocol that is in the readable format	It is a binary protocol

2.	If not found in cache, ISPâ€™s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find IP address. The request are send in small pockets that continues information content of request & IP  address.
3.	Browser initiates the TCP connection with server using Synchronize(SYN) and acknowledge (ACK) message.
4.	Browser sends a HTTP request to server. GET or POST request.
